    "# Executive summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to enhance customer support services by leveraging Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing techniques. We will transcribe a sample customer audio call and analyze a dataset of pre-transcribed customer calls to extract insights such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the audio compatible for future speech recognition modeling?\n",
    "2. How many calls have a true positive sentiment?\n",
    "3. What is the most frequently named entity across all of the transcriptions?\n",
    "4. Which call is the most similar to 'wrong package delivery'?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | Column            | Type   | Description                                        |\n",
    "| ----- | ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 0     | `text`            | object | Transcription of the customer call                 |\n",
    "| 1     | `sentiment_label` | object | Whether the call is positive, neutral, or negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement speech recognition and calculate audio statistics\n",
    "2. Perform sentiment analysis\n",
    "3. Run named entity recognition\n",
    "4. Find most similar texts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The audio file has 1 channel and a frame rate of 44100 Hz.\n",
    "- True positive sentiment count: 2\n",
    "- Most frequently entity: yesterday\n",
    "- Most similar text to 'wrong package delivery': 'wrong package delivered'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully transcribed a customer support call and analyzed a dataset of transcriptions to extract valuable insights. The findings can help improve customer service quality by addressing common issues and understanding customer sentiment better."
