    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix, founded in 1997, has transformed from a DVD rental service to a leading global entertainment platform. With a vast library of movies and series, Netflix offers a unique opportunity to explore trends in the entertainment industry. This report focuses on analyzing Netflix's movie offerings, particularly those from the 1990s, to provide insights for a production company specialising in nostalgic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s?\n",
    "2. How many short movies (less than 90 minutes) were action movies released in the 1990s?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data overview\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the data for movies released in the 1990s\n",
    "2. Find the most frequent movie duration\n",
    "3. Count the number of short action movies from the 1990s\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most frequent movie duration in the 1990s was 90 minutes.\n",
    "- There were 15 short action movies (less than 90 minutes) released in the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of Netflix movies from the 1990s reveals that 90-minute movies were the most common duration, aligning with traditional movie lengths. Additionally, the presence of 15 short action movies indicates a niche market for concise, action-packed content. These insights can guide the production company in creating content that resonates with audiences seeking nostalgic entertainment."
