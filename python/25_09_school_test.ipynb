    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It is intended to assess a student's readiness for college and provide colleges with a common data point that can be used to compare all applicants. The SAT consists of three main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, Math, and an optional Essay. Each section is scored on a scale of 200 to 800, with a total possible score ranging from 400 to 1600.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which schools are best for math?\n",
    "2. How do the top 10 schools compare in terms of total SAT scores?\n",
    "3. Which borough has the highest standard deviation in SAT scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column            | Description                            |\n",
    "|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `school_name`     | Name of school                         |\n",

    "| `building_code`   | Code for the building                  |\n",
    "| `average_math`    | Average math score for SATs            |\n",
    "| `average_reading` | Average reading score for SATs         |\n",
    "| `average_writing` | Average writing score for SATs         |\n",
    "| `percent_tested`  | Percentage of students completing SATs |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding schools with the best math scores\n",
    "2. Identifying the top 10 performing schools\n",
    "3. Locating the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation in SAT performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best schools for math are:\n",
    "  1. Stuyvesant High School\n",
    "  2. Bronx High School of Science\n",
    "  3. Staten Island Technical High School\t\n",
    "  4. Queens High School for the Sciences at York College\n",

    "  9. New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School\n",
    "  10. Eleanor Roosevelt High School\n",
    "- The top 10 performing schools in terms of total SAT scores are:\n",
    "  1. Stuyvesant High School\n",
    "  2. Bronx High School of Science\n",
    "  3. Staten Island Technical High School\n",
    "  4. High School of American Studies at Lehman College\n",
    "  5. Townsend Harris High School\n",

    "  7. Bard High School Early College\n",
    "  8. Brooklyn Technical High School\t\n",
    "  9. Eleanor Roosevelt High School\n",
    "  10. High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering at City College\n",
    "- The borough with the largest standard deviation in SAT scores is Manhattan, with a standard deviation of 230.29.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "  \n",
    "The analysis of NYC public school SAT performance reveals that specialised high schools such as Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science consistently achieve the highest scores in both math and overall SAT performance. This indicates a strong emphasis on academic excellence in these institutions. Additionally, Manhattan stands out as the borough with the highest variability in SAT scores, suggesting a diverse range of school performances within that area. These insights can inform parents, educators, and policymakers in making decisions regarding school selection and resource allocation to enhance educational outcomes across NYC."
