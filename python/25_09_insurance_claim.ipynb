    "\n",
    "1. Reading in and exploring the dataset\n",
    "2. Filling missing values\n",
    "3. Preparing for modeling\n",
    "4. Building and storing the models\n",
    "5. Measuring performance\n",
    "6. Finding the best performing model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best feature:** `driving_experience` was found to be the most predictive of whether a customer would make a claim. Less experienced drivers have a higher claim rate.\n",
    "- **Best accuracy:** The model using `driving_experience` as the predictor achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 0.78.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis identified `driving_experience` as the most significant predictor of insurance claims among the features evaluated. This insight can help the company to refine their risk assessment and pricing strategies, focusing on driver experience as a key factor in claim likelihood."
