    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer service calls play a crucial role in shaping customer satisfaction and loyalty. Understanding the nature of these calls, whether they occur before or after a purchase, can provide valuable insights for businesses to enhance their customer service strategies. This report focuses on building a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a customer call is pre-purchase or post-purchase based on various features extracted from the call data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How accurate is the Naive Bayes classifier in predicting the type of customer call?\n",
    "2. What are the key features that contribute to the classification of customer calls?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column  | Type   | Description                                       |\n",
    "| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `label` | object | Whether the call is pre-purchase or post-purchase |\n",
    "| `text`  | object | Transcription of the customer call                |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create text_classifier using CountVectorizer(), TfidfTransformer(), and MultinomialNB()\n",
    "2. Fit text_classifier on train_df.text and train_df.label\n",
    "3. Create predicted by calling predict() on text_classifier and passing it the text column of test_df\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model by seeing how predicted compares to the test_df.label\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 95.24% on the test set, indicating a strong ability to distinguish between pre-purchase and post-purchase calls.\n",
    "- Key features contributing to the classification included specific keywords and phrases commonly associated with pre-purchase inquiries (e.g. wondering, looking) and post-purchase issues (e.g. received, wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates the potential of using machine learning techniques, such as Naive Bayes, to enhance customer service strategies. By accurately classifying customer calls, businesses can tailor their support efforts to better meet customer needs and improve overall satisfaction."
