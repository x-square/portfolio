    "\n",
    "1. Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "2. Converting integers, floats, and unordered categories\n",

    "4. Filtering on ordered categorical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory reduction**: The overall memory footprint of the dataset has been decreased by approximately 30% after converting data types and filtering records.\n",
    "- **Data integrity**: Careful consideration was given to ensure that data integrity was maintained throughout the optimization process.\n",
    "- **Relevant subset**: The filtered dataset now focuses on students with relevant experience and those from companies of a certain size, making it more suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully achieved its goals of reducing memory usage and focusing on a relevant subset of students. These improvements will facilitate more efficient modeling and analysis, ultimately enhancing the performance of predictive models used for student job placement."
