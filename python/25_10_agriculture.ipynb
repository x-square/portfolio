    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers need to decide which crop to plant each season to maximize their yield. Soil condition is a crucial factor affecting crop growth, and measuring soil metrics can be expensive. The goal is to identify the most important soil feature that predicts the best crop choice using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which feature in the dataset produces the best score for predicting crop?\n",
    "2. What is the best predictive feature and its evaluation score?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | Column | Type    | Description                                   |\n",
    "| ----- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 0     | `N`    | int64   | Nitrogen ratio in the soil                   |\n",
    "| 1     | `P`    | int64   | Phosphor ratio in the soil                   |\n",

    "| 4     | `crop` | object  | Categorical values that contain various crops |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data into a pandas DataFrame and perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "2. Split the data\n",
    "3. Evaluate feature performance\n",
    "4. Create the best_predictive_feature variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1-scores for each feature are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1-score for N: 0.09\n",
    "- F1-score for P: 0.15\n",
    "- F1-score for K: 0.24\n",
    "- F1-score for ph: 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Potassium was identified as the best predictive feature for classifying crop types, achieving the highest F1-score of 0.24. This insight can help farmers prioritize measuring potassium levels in their soil to make informed decisions about crop selection, ultimately maximizing their yield. However, the overall low F1-scores suggest that relying on a single soil feature may not be sufficient for accurate crop prediction, indicating the need for a more comprehensive approach that considers multiple soil properties."
