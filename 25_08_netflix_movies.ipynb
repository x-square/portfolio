    "Netflix, founded in 1997, has transformed from a DVD rental service to a leading global entertainment platform. With a vast library of movies and series, Netflix offers a unique opportunity to explore trends in the entertainment industry. This report focuses on analyzing Netflix's movie offerings, particularly those from the 1990s, to provide insights for a production company specialising in nostalgic content.\n",
